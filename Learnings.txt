import gsap, { ScrollTrigger, SplitText } from 'gsap/all';
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, SplitText);

putting these two lines in app will allow the global access of these gsap plugins
ScrollTrigger allw us to animate things based on scroll position
SplitText allow us to bra=eak words into individual letter/characters for better control over our animation


utility classes are used to make things easier to write code and shorten it 
these are not default classes but created seperatly
@utility flex-center {
  @apply flex justify-center items-center
}
defined like these and can be used directly in className

in map function if we use .map(() => {}) then we need to use return keyword to return something but to directly return it we can use () paranthesis

navTween=> {
    Tweening in animation is short fot inbetweening, and it's the process of generating images that go between keyframes
}

scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: 'nav', //element position
    start: 'bottom top' //controlls when the scroll animation starts and ends
}
